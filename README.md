## Challenge

This project was created as a solo, final project for the Coding Dojo bootcamp. 
This was created as a full-stack web application do both demonstrate what I have learned 
and provide an opportunity for teaching myself new concepts. In this project, I learned how to upload
photos using Python with a Flask framework.

## Design

The design of this site is meant to inspire a traveler with images from around the world. I also challenged myself 
not to use any Bootstrap or similar styling framework, and to write all of my styling from scratch.
